# Opensource Embeded Toolchains under Linux

This project aims to provide a series of step by step tutorials and related resources/tools/project templates to setup **opensource toolchains** and development environment **under Linux** for various common **embeded devices**. 

It will include but not limited to 8051/avr/stm8/stm32/riscv/fpga etc. 

These tutorials are not aim to teach beginners how to write codes for specific MCU. although some project templates or examples to demo how to run a toolchain will be provided, but it's not the first goal.

The first goal of this project is **to help beginners setup a workable toolchain and development environment to start MCU development quickly under Linux**, and to show the power of opensource software and what opensource community have done.

## What's a toolchain

A 'toolchain' gennerally means a set of programming tools include assembler/compiler/linker and debugger etc. for example, PC linux distributions provide 'binutils' as assembler/linker and various binary related tools, gcc/clang as compilers, gdb/lldb as debugger. the 'C compiler' pre-process source files and translate it to asm and the assembler 'gas' translate asm sources to target objects, and the linker 'ld/gold/lld' link various objects together and generate the final ELF binary, maybe it's a excutable binary or a library. (by the way, Clang/LLVM is a little bit difference, since it supports IR format)

Acctually, you can always treat "compiler" as "translator", but a more complex "translator", and treat 'binary' such as ELF as a 'file format'. since it's a 'file format' with some rules, it can be generated any way even by hand.

You may need project managing tools to help you organize and build source files instead of typing compilation commands every time, there are make/automake/autoconf/ninja/cmake/scons/meson, etc.

You may also need an editor to write codes, there are vim/emacs/vscode, etc.

That's to say, in narrow senseï¼Œ'toolchain' is compiler and debugger. generally, a 'toolchain' should include all tools you need to do the software development. 

For embeded devices, beside compilers/debuggers, it should also include a flashing/programming tool to help you 'transfer' the softwares to target devices, we usually call such software for embeded device as 'firmware', it may have or have not an operating system. by the way, we call it 'baremetal' if without a OS. 

## What's a cross-compile toolchain

Usually, we work with a PC/Laptop with Intel or AMD CPU and with Linux installed, the toolchain described above run on X86_64 architechture and generate binaries for X86_64 architechture. for example, linux OS can build itself on the same Linux OS and gcc/clang can build itself by gcc/clang. we call this as '**bootstrap**', means it can build itself by itself.

But we may also need to run toolchains on PC and generate binaries run on other ARCH, such as ARM, AARCH64, MIPS, RISC-V, etc. Such a toolchain called '**cross-compile**' toolchain. you may already use it before, for example, NDK toolchain of Android or IOS toolchain, it run on X86 PC host but generate binaries for ARM target.

You may already notice that commands of such a 'cross-compile' toolchain always start with a special string, such as 'arm-none-eabi-gcc', and may also find such a string if you run 'gcc' on your PC linux, for example, "x86_64-redhat-linux". such a string called **['triplet'](https://wiki.osdev.org/Target_Triplet)**, toolchain's triplet have this simple structure: 

```
machine-vendor-operatingsystem
```

The 'machine' field usually contains a 'architechture' name, such as x86_64, arm, aarch64, riscv, etc. the 'vendor' field usually contains the brand of vendor, and the 'operatingsystem' usually contains the os name, the c library name or abi name.

For instance:
* 'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu' means target is x86_64 machine / unknown vendor / linux OS with glibc.
* 'x86_64-alpine-linux-musl' means target is x86_64 machine / alpine linux / linux OS with musl libc.
* 'arm-none-eabi' means target is arm machine / not limited to specific vendor / without requiring of a os and with embedded-application binary interface(EABI) support

Besides above rules, toolchian's triplet can be used by compilers to find corresponding assemblers/linkers with same triplet. for example, a 'arm-none-eabi-gcc' usually use 'arm-none-eabi-as' as its assembler, it's not mandary but a convention in toolchain's source codes.

For a 'cross-compile' toolchain with OS support, there is also need a target os '**sysroot**' which contains the root filesystem and libraries of target system that the compiler can find headers and link to target libs.

For embeded device, we mostly work with a cross-compile toochain and compile sources on X86 PC to generate the target binaries. most MCU do NOT require a seperate OS installed, we call it as 'baremetal'.


## Toolchain Tutorials

This project will include but not limited to below tutorials, every tutorial and related resources will be provided by a seperate repo:

- [8051](https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-8051)(mainly for STC51 series)
- [STM8](https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-stm8)
- PIC?
- MSP430?
- AVR
  - low priority since Arduino has a great development platform for Linux.
- STM32
- [GD32VF103(RISC-V 32bit MCU based on nuclei core)](https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-gd32vf103)
- CH32V(RISC-V 32bit MCU based on nuclei core)
  - I still consider write a tutorial for it or not. since its vendor use modified OpenOCD to support private protocol RVSWD but not opensourced, we should resist using such product.
- RaspberryPi PICO RP2040
- Lattice FPGA ECP5/ICE40
- Gowin FPGA littlebee
- Allwinner D1 nezha(not MCU)
  - PhoenixCard (the SD card image burning tool) is not opensource and only for Windows.
